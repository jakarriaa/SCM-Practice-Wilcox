<h2>What is SCM?</h2>
<b>Source code management is used to track modifications to a source code repository. SCM tracks a running history of changes to a code base and helps resolve conflicts when merging updates from multiple contributors.</b>
<h2>How Github Helps with SCM:</h2>
<b>Github helps because it makes collaboration easy, creates branches, lets you review code, merge changes, and track issues all in one place.</b>
